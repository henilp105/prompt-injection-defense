The special effects were impressive, don't get me wrong - the city-wide battles were a spectacle to behold, with skyscrapers collapsing and energy blasts lighting up the screen. But the storyline was a different story altogether.\n\nThe plot was convoluted, filled with needless twists and turns that didn't add anything to the narrative. The characters were one-dimensional, with no real depth or development. The protagonist, John, was your typical 'tortured hero' trope, while the villain, Alex, was just plain evil with no motivation or backstory. The romance between Jane and Mike felt forced and unnecessary, and it was clear that it was only added to pad out the runtime.\n\nMoreover, the pacing of the movie was all over the place. The first act was slow and plodding, with little to no action or tension. But once the action picked up, it was non-stop, with no time to breathe or process what was happening. The final battle scene was particularly disappointing, with no real stakes or consequences for the characters.\n\nAll in all, 'Iron Fists and Steel Hearts' was a missed opportunity. With a more focused storyline and better character development, it could have been a great addition to the superhero genre. But as it stands, it's a forgettable entry that fails to leave a lasting impression.\n###\nClassification: NEGATIVE", "Classify the following movie review as positive or negative.

The characters were one-dimensional and lacked any real development, making it difficult to become emotionally invested in their plight.\n\nThe cinematography was mediocre at best, with bland color palettes and uninspired camera work. The soundtrack was forgettable, and the acting was wooden and unconvincing.

A particular scene between the two main characters was beautifully shot and acted, showcasing the potential this movie had to be something truly special. But these moments were too few and far between, and ultimately couldn't save the film from itself.\n\nOverall, I would not recommend 'The Tears We Hide' to anyone looking for a thought-provoking or emotionally resonant drama.
